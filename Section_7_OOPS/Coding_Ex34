// QUESTION

// Carpet Cost Calculator Class


// The Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price of carpeting for rectangular rooms. To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the floor (width times length) by the price per square meter of carpet. For example, the area of the floor that is 12 meters long and 10 meters wide is 120 square meters. To cover the floor with a carpet that costs $8 per square meter would cost $960.

// 1. Write a class with the name Floor. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width and length of type double.

// The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.

// In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the length parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.

// Write the following methods (instance methods):

// Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (width * length).



// 2. Write a class with the name Carpet. The class needs one field (instance variable) with name cost of type double.

// The class needs to have one constructor with parameter cost of type double and it needs to initialize the field.

// In case the cost parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the cost field value to 0.

// Write the following methods (instance methods):

// Method named getCost without any parameters, it needs to return the value of cost field



// 3. Write a class with the name Calculator. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name floor of type Floor and carpet of type Carpet.

// The class needs to have one constructor with parameters floor of type Floor and carpet of type Carpet and it needs to initialize the fields.

// Write the following methods (instance methods):

// Method named getTotalCost without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated total cost to cover the floor with a carpet.



// Floor.java
public class Floor {
 
    private double width;
    private double length;
 
    public Floor(double width, double length) {
        
        if (width < 0) {
            width = 0;
        }
 
        if (length < 0) {
            length = 0;
        }
 
        this.width = width;
        this.length = length;
    }
 
    public double getArea() {
        return width * length;
    }
}
 
// Carpet.java
public class Carpet {
 
    private double cost;
 
    public Carpet(double cost) {
        if (cost < 0) {
            cost = 0;
        }
        this.cost = cost;
    }
 
    public double getCost() {
        return cost;
    }
}
 
// Calculator.java
public class Calculator {
 
    private Floor floor;
    private Carpet carpet;
 
    public Calculator(Floor floor, Carpet carpet) {
        this.floor = floor;
        this.carpet = carpet;
    }
 
    public double getTotalCost() {
        return floor.getArea() * carpet.getCost();
    }
}
// Example Usage:

// CodingEx34.java
// This class demonstrates the functionality of the Floor, Carpet, and Calculator classes.


public class Coding_Ex34 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Floor floor = new Floor(3.55, 5.0);
        Carpet carpet = new Carpet(2.5);
        Calculator calculate = new Calculator(floor,carpet);
        System.out.println(" Area is : " + calculate.getTotalCost());
        carpet = new Carpet(1.50);
        floor = new Floor(5.4, 4.5);
        calculate = new Calculator(floor, carpet);
        System.out.println("total= " + calculate.getTotalCost());
    }
}
// Output:
// Area is : 44.375
// total= 40.5
